//! The wire protocol between the scanner worker and its parent process.
//!
//! Reading plugin metadata means loading arbitrary third-party native code, which
//! segfaults, hangs, and occasionally calls `exit()`. None of that is recoverable
//! in-process, so the worker is supervised and restarted rather than trusted.
//!
//! The worker writes one JSON object per line to stdout and flushes after each,
//! and everything else -- logging, progress -- goes to stderr so stdout stays
//! parseable.
//!
//! The ordering is what makes crash attribution possible:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"event":"begin","path":"...\\Serum.vst3"}     <- BEFORE the load is attempted
//! {"event":"result","path":"...","status":"success","plugins":[...]}
//! {"event":"done","scanned":1}
//! ```
//!
//! A `begin` with no matching `result` names the plugin that killed the worker. Without
//! that line a crash tells the parent only that the batch died, leaving it unable to
//! either skip the offender or record a useful error against it.
