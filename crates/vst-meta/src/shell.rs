//! VST2 shell-plugin enumeration.
//!
//! A "shell" plugin is one binary that contains many logical plugins (Waves bundles,
//! some Kontakt builds). Loading it normally yields a single container reporting
//! `Category::Shell`, and none of the real plugins inside it.
//!
//! The VST 2.4 protocol for unpacking it is a two-step handshake:
//!
//! 1. The host repeatedly dispatches `effShellGetNextPlugin` (here
//!    `plugin::OpCode::ShellGetNextPlugin`) to the container. Each call returns the
//!    next sub-plugin's unique id and writes its name into a caller-supplied buffer.
//!    A return of 0 ends the list.
//! 2. To then load one specific sub-plugin, the host instantiates the binary *again*
//!    and answers the plugin's `CurrentId` host-callback with the desired unique id.
//!    The plugin consults that during its own init and becomes that sub-plugin.
//!
//! Step 2 is reachable through the safe API: that is exactly what `Host::get_plugin_id`
//! is for (see [`crate::scan::MetadataHost`]). Step 1 is not -- `PluginInstance` keeps its
//! `AEffect` pointer private and the crate's `Dispatch` trait is not exported, so
//! there is no way to send opcode `ShellGetNextPlugin` through it. This module
//! therefore opens its own short-lived handle to the binary and dispatches directly.
