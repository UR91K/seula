//! Search-related gRPC tests
//!
//! MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
//! Move any search-related tests from src/grpc/server.rs if they exist
//! (Most search tests are in src/database/search.rs, but there might be 
//! gRPC-specific search endpoint tests)

use super::*;
use crate::common::setup;

// TODO: Check src/grpc/server.rs for any search endpoint tests
// TODO: These would test the Search gRPC endpoint specifically, not the underlying search logic
// TODO: If no dedicated gRPC search tests exist, this file can remain minimal or be removed
