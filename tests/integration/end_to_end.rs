//! End-to-end integration tests
//!
//! MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
//! These tests might not exist yet, but this is where you would put
//! full system integration tests that test the entire workflow from
//! scanning to database to gRPC serving.
//!
//! ALSO MOVE LIVESET TESTS:
//! Move the following tests from src/live_set.rs:
//! - test_load_real_project() (line ~274)  
//! - test_load_project_benchmark() (line ~315)
//! These are integration-style tests that load real project files

// TODO: Could include tests that start a real gRPC server and test full client workflows
// TODO: Move the LiveSet integration tests from src/live_set.rs (2 tests)
